# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture decisions that shape the codebase: what we chose, what we rejected, and why. They exist so that neither humans nor agents re-litigate (or silently reverse) settled decisions.

## Rules

- One decision per file: `NNNN-short-slug.md`, numbered sequentially. Use [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md).
- Status is one of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by NNNN`.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted — supersede, don't edit history.
- Write one whenever you: add/replace a dependency with architectural weight, change module boundaries, change a CI gate, change the data-flow model, or make any choice a future reader would ask "why is it like this?" about.
- Agents: if your task requires deviating from an accepted ADR, stop and surface it. Propose a superseding ADR; do not quietly diverge.
